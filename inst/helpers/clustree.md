## Clustering Tree

Clustering analysis is used in many contexts to group similar samples. One problem when conducting this kind of analysis is how many clusters to use. A clustering tree visualises the relationships between clusters at a range of resolutions.

We can see how clusters are related to each other, which are clearly distinct and which are unstable (Zappia and Oshlack 2018).
