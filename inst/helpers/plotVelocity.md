# RNA Velocity

Plot RNA Velocity of data using [velocyto](https://velocyto.org/). Velocity can be represented on UMAP or tSNE as arrows or a grid. Plots can be displayed within the app or exported to pdf. 

Velocyto requires the generation of a [loom](https://velocyto.org/velocyto.py/tutorial/cli.html#about-the-output-loom-file) file. This file must be generated separately from the seurat object. To enable plotting of RNA velocity, the path to the corresponding loom file must be provided.
