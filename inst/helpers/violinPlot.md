# Violin Plot

Feature (gene or transcript) expression can be viewed by violin plot based on sample metadata

Violin plots are a hybrid of density and box plots. It shows probability density of the data at different values. The horizontal line is a marker for the median of the data and the box shows the interquartile ranges.

The parameter 'Variable to group by' needs to be chosen whereas the other two are optional (useful for subsetting):
1. 'Variable to filter by'
2. 'Value to filter by'
